RPGToolkit, Version 3 :: Installation Program

To build the installer:

a) prepare a zip.zip from \build (plus trans3.exe, toolkit3.exe, and actkrt3.dll)

b) build prjSetup as setup.exe

c) place setup.exe, zip.zip, tkzip.dll, helper.exe, and build.bat in the same directory

d) run build.bat

e) now setup.exe is a standalone installer!
