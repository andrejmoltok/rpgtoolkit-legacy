RPGToolkit, Version 3 :: Installation Program

To build the installer:

a) prepare a zip.zip from \build (plus trans3.exe and toolkit3.exe)

b) build prjSetup as setup.exe

c) place setup.exe, zip.zip, tkzip.dll, helper.exe, and build.bat in the same directory

d) run build.bat

e) now setup.exe is a standalone installer!
