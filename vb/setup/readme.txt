RPGToolkit, Version 3 :: Installation Program

To build the installer:

a) prepare a zip.zip (this will contain uninstall.exe built from prjUninstaller)

b) build prjSetup as setup.exe

c) place setup.exe, zip.zip, tkzip.dll, helper.exe, and build.bat in the same directory

d) run build.bat

e) now setup.exe is a standalone installer!
