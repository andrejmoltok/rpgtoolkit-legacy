 * RPGCode garbage collector.
 *
 * This is a just a naive implementation of a garbage collector that
 * runs in its own thread. At regular intervals, it suspends the main
 * program thread (there is assumed to be only one) and checks if there
 * are any objects that are not referenced by any variable. If there are,
 * they are freed. There deconstructors are not called, though, since
 * there is no easy way to tell where that code even is. So, if a class's
 * deconstructor actually needs to be run, it should be run manually.

 * that is run even when programs are not running, or else programs
